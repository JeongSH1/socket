allow host to dynamically obtain its IP adress from network server when it joins network.
DHCP

translate the global unique IP adress to private IP adress, also its reverse.
NAT

obtain subnet reachability information from neighboring ASes.
eBGP

propagate reachability information to all AS-internal routers.
iBGP

the layer that moving data from node to close node.
linklayer

the layer that deal with forwarding and routing.
networklayer

Identification number that uniquely define the hardware interface.
MACadress

Identification number that provided for connections on the network.
IPadress

determines how datagram arriving on router input port is forwarded to router output port in network layer.
dataplane

determines how datagram is routed among routers along end to end path from source host to destination host.
controlplane

which allowing some packets to pass or blocking others.
firewall

the MAC protocol that split the frequency and allocate to nodes.
FDMA

the MAC protocol that breaking down the channel from a time perspective.
TDMA

the random access protocol that listen to other channel which sending the data before transmit.
CSMA

dominant wired LAN technology that is simpler and cheaper than previous technologies.
Ethernet

the link-layer device that based on MAC address.
switch

the network-layer device that based on IP address and use .
router

the protocol that determining MAC address through IP address.
ARP

the technology that transform hardware equipment to software foundation.
SDN

the device that connected without going through a router.
subnet
